will be ready once i have time (never)

## TODO

- get a better (maybe dedicated?) server
- matrix homeserver - only synapse supports sso and i consider synapse trash.
- monero node
- ethereum node (depends on the amount of storage the server will have)
- vaultwarden instance (but it doesn't support SSO, at least yet)
- figure out the most annoying way to register because I'm greedy.
  - ppl open a PR to add themselves to kanidm shared between all services. Easy enough, slight inconvenience, and I can easily filter people manually
  - hold a nft - forced donate, very annoying so someone must really want to have an account on here, lol. would need to research if there's any decent SSO software with walletconnect and verifying NFT ownership.
